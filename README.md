# My Scripts
## My Assorted Bash Scripts

These are my scripts, some of which require packages to be installed, but I will provide descriptions for them below.

This is my custom GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper. I specifically made it for new Linux users who need to know the command line.

This was my first script. I copied it from a MUO article and changed it a bit.

This counts the days until a date.

# HideMessenger.SH & ShowMessenger.SH
I use this to hide and show my server's IT window.

# Install & Install.SH
I coded this to easily integrate my PICO-8 itch.io games into my system. The file Install is just a GUI version.
**Prerequisites:** zip

# Lightdm.SH
I use this so that I always have a tty running lightdm, so that the switch user button on the KDE lockscreen will work.

# LockOffKDE.SH
This uses xset to turn the screen off and lock it, since KDE does not turn the screen off when locking.
**Prerequisites:** xset

This is a template for install.sh it goes in the game directory and you run it to uninstall the PICO-8 game
