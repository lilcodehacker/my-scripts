# My Scripts
## My Assorted Bash Scripts

These are my scripts, some of which require packages to be installed, but I will provide descriptions for them below.

# Assistant.SH
This is my custom GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper. I specifically made it for new Linux users who need to know the command line.
**Prerequisites:** gh, github account

# Calc.SH
This was my first script. I copied it from a MUO article and changed it a bit.
**Prerequisites:** bc

# DaysUntil.SH
This counts the days until a date.
**Prerequisites:** date

# Install & Install.SH
I coded this to integrate my PICO-8 itch.io games into my system easily. The file Install is just a GUI version.
**Prerequisites:** zip

# Lightdm.SH
I use this so that I always have a tty running, allowing the switch user button on the KDE lock screen to function properly.
**Prerequisites:** w, lightdm

# LockOffKDE.SH
This uses xset to turn the screen off and lock it, since KDE does not turn the screen off when locking.
**Prerequisites:** xset

# Qapt.SH
This will take an apt link and open it using the Qapt Package installer
**Prerequisites:** qapt

# Uninstall.SH
This is a template for install.sh it goes in the game directory, and you run it to uninstall the PICO-8 game
**Prerequisites:** none

# Reverse dictionary 
This is my first Python script. It gives you a definition, and you have to guess the word
**Prerequisites:** python3 random_word wordhoard (both of the latter are python libraries)
